		<br>My project aims to help people have more of a reason to get exercise as well as feel more rewarded afterwards.<br>Similar to how Pokemon Go gave many people incentive to go out to earn virtual things for a game.
		My game will<br> turn the amount of steps you take into a currency in game. This rewards people for steps they may already take in<br> their day to day lives and may even incentivise them to walk extra.
		The game will be in the idle game style. These<br> are game where you don't usually activly play for long sessions, but rather you will regularly check on it. The genre <br>of game encourages upgrading things in game, likely to increase income, close it and then check on it later in the day.

		<p>An example of a popular game in this idle style is Cookie Clicker.

		First you click the cookie to get a single cookie. When you have enough you can buy cursors which will click for you. Now you'll be earning more cookies. Then you can save up for a grandma which will produce you more cookies. This continues with various upgrades and buildings from cookie farms to portals the lead to the cookie dimension.
		As for the functionality of my game I would need to use the pedometer in the phone. This is what measures the amount of steps you take. It does this buy counting a step whenever you phone is moved.
		However this could easily be taken advantage of by shaking your phone. To fix this problem I think you could combine the pedometer with gps location. This way the application will only count steps when it senses the jolts of your steps as well as your moving location through the gps.
		From there it would only be about constructing the game aspects such as what the games theme is, what the upgrades are, how much everything costs etc.
